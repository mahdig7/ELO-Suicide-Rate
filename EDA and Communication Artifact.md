### Insights
<ul>
<li> Based on the line plot, the period between 1997 and 2004 stands out as a period with the highest peak in suicide rates per 100,000 population.</li>
<li> There is a noticeable decreasing trend in suicide rates after the year 2009. </li>
</ul>

## Question 2: How have the trends in sex-based suicide rates evolved over the years?

### Insights
<ul>
<li>The plot shows a decreasing trend in suicide rates for both males and females over the years. This suggests a positive change in suicide prevention and mental health awareness.</li>
<li>The blue line representing male suicide rates consistently remains higher than the red line representing female suicide rates. This aligns with the well-documented fact that males generally have higher suicide rates compared to females.</li>
<li>Both male and female suicide rates exhibit similar patterns of fluctuations over time. This implies that there might be common underlying factors influencing suicide rates regardless of gender.</li>
<li>The plot indicates a peak in suicide rates for both sexes around the mid-1990s. This could be attributed to various socio-economic, cultural, or psychological factors prevalent during that time.</li>
</ul>

## Question 3: What are the trends in suicide rates across different age groups over time?

### Insights
<ul>
<li>High Suicide Rates in Older Age Groups: The age group of 55-74 years consistently exhibits a significant suicide rate. This suggests that older individuals may face unique challenges or circumstances that contribute to higher suicide risk.</li>
<li>Highest Suicide Rate: The age group of 35-54 years shows the highest numbers in suicide rates over time. This may indicate the influence of various factors such as societal changes, mental health issues, or social pressures affecting this age group population.</li>
</ul>

## Question 4: What are the gender differences in suicide rates across different age groups?
![image](https://github.com/mahdig7/ELO-Suicide-Rate/assets/107054053/f37ad027-cf78-4615-b44b-0beb03e93a8c)
### Insights
<ul>
<li>	Gender Disparities: The stacked bar chart highlights noticeable gender disparities in suicide rates across different age groups. In all age brackets, males consistently have higher total suicide numbers compared to females. This suggests that males are more vulnerable to suicide across various stages of life. </li>
<li>	Higher Suicide Rates in Middle-Aged Adults: The age group of "35-54 years" exhibits the highest total suicide numbers for both males and females. This indicates that middle-aged adults face a greater risk of suicide compared to other age groups. </li>
<li>	Substantial Difference in Suicide Rate of Middle-Aged Adults Between the Genders: The age group of "35-54 years" stands out as having the highest total suicide numbers for both males and females. However, the noticeably higher total suicide numbers among males in this age group indicate a heightened risk of suicide among middle-aged men. </li>
</ul>

## Question 5: What is the impact of generational differences on suicide rates over time?

### Insights
<ul>
<li>	Silent Generation (born 1925-1945) and Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964) have consistently higher suicide rates compared to other generations throughout the observed years. They exhibit a relatively stable trend with some minor fluctuations. </li>
<li>	Generation X (born 1965-1980) and Millennials (born 1981-1996) show a significant increase in suicide rates after 2010. Afterward, the rates gradually decline.</li>
<li> Generation Z (born 1997 and later) has the lowest suicide rates among the generations considered. The rates are relatively stable with minor fluctuations. </li>
<li> Notably, the Baby Boomers initially had the highest suicide rates among all generations, but their rates have been gradually decreasing over time. In contrast, Generation X, which came after Baby Boomers, experienced an increase in suicide rates before showing a declining trend. </li>
<li>	The Silent Generation has consistently high suicide rates over the years, indicating that this generation has been consistently vulnerable to suicide.</li>
</ul>

## Question 6: How do the total number of suicides differ between males and females from 1985 to 2015?

### Insights
The ratio of male to female suicides has been approximately 3.5 males for every female.

## Question 7: What are the top 10 countries with the highest suicide rates?
![image](https://github.com/mahdig7/ELO-Suicide-Rate/assets/107054053/dd92a633-d4ee-4fb9-b842-5379f0620900)
### Insights
<ul>
<li>	Russia has the highest suicide rate among the selected countries, accounting for a significant proportion of the total suicides.</li>
<li> Eastern European countries, such as Ukraine and Poland, are also represented in the top 10, indicating a relatively higher suicide rate in this region. </li>
 </ul>

 ## Question 8: Which countries have the lowest suicide rate?
 ![image](https://github.com/mahdig7/ELO-Suicide-Rate/assets/107054053/e572d2f7-6bac-4d3c-9714-5162e1b59863)
### Insights
Consistent lower rates: The bar heights consistently portray low suicide rates across all the countries in the bottom 10. This suggests that these nations may have implemented effective measures to prevent suicide.

## Question 9: What is the correlation between GDP per capita and suicide rates among males and females across different countries, and how does this correlation differ between genders?
![image](https://github.com/mahdig7/ELO-Suicide-Rate/assets/107054053/b3e11cb5-5827-4916-b397-30ebca27833d)
### Insights
<ul>
<li> Gender Differences: There is a clear distinction between male and female data points. The blue data points represent males, while the orange data points represent females. This differentiation allows for a comparison of suicide rates based on gender. </li>
<li> Negative Correlation: Overall, there appears to be a negative correlation between GDP per capita and suicide rates. As GDP per capita increases, the total number of suicides generally decreases. This pattern is evident for both males and females. </li>
<li> Gender-Specific Patterns: Males tend to have higher suicide rates compared to females across different levels of GDP per capita. The blue data points, representing males, are generally above the orange data points, indicating higher suicide rates for males at similar GDP per capita levels. </li>
<li>	Outliers: There are a few outliers in the data, particularly for males. These outliers represent countries with relatively high suicide rates despite higher GDP per capita. Exploring these outliers can provide insights into unique circumstances or factors contributing to higher suicide rates. </li>
<li> Overlapping Regions: There are regions where the male and female data points overlap or closely cluster together. This suggests that there are similarities in suicide rates between genders, irrespective of GDP per capita. It may be worth investigating the underlying social, cultural, or psychological factors that contribute to these similarities. </li>
</ul>

## Question 10: Which are the top 4 countries with the highest suicide rates, and their trend over the years?

### Insights
<ul>
<li> Russia exhibits a fluctuating pattern in suicide rates, with a significant peak around the year 1995. </li>
<li> The United States shows an increasing suicide trend, with some minor fluctuations over the years. </li>
<li> Japan experienced a peak in suicide rates during the late 1990s and early 2000s, followed by a gradual decline in recent years. </li>
</ul>

## Question 11: How did the average suicide rate in the United States change before and after the Great Recession of 2008 (during the years 2005-2010)?
![image](https://github.com/mahdig7/ELO-Suicide-Rate/assets/107054053/9d4f6dc3-c463-4b01-bf82-7bacd390e722)
## Insights
<ul>
<li> The line chart shows and increase in number of suicides in US in the years leading to and after the great recession of 2008. Thereby, showing that GDP is an important factor in predicting suicide rates. </li>
<li> Economic contraction: The US experienced a severe economic downturn during the recession, characterized by a contraction in economic activity. GDP growth declined significantly, leading to a decline in overall economic output. </li>
<li>	Unemployment surge: The recession led to a sharp increase in unemployment rates across the country. Many businesses faced financial difficulties and were forced to lay off employees or reduce their workforce, resulting in widespread job losses. </li>
<li> Financial sector crisis: The recession was triggered by a financial sector crisis, primarily stemming from the collapse of the housing market and the subprime mortgage crisis. Financial institutions faced significant losses, credit markets froze, and many banks and financial companies were on the brink of failure. </li>
</ul>
