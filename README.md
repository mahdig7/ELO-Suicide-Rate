# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization on Suicide Rate (1985 â€“ 2016) Dataset
## Overview
Understanding suicide rates is of paramount importance as it is a significant public health issue with far-reaching consequences. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into the factors associated with suicide and develop effective prevention strategies. However, the complexities involved in studying suicide make it a challenging problem to tackle.
The motivations for exploring this dataset and defining specific project questions arise from the need to address the alarming global suicide rates and their impact on individuals, families, and communities. Preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps us understand the dataset's structure, identify trends, patterns, and potential relationships, and formulate research questions.
