# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization on Suicide Rate (1985 â€“ 2016) Dataset
## Overview
Understanding suicide rates is of paramount importance as it is a significant public health issue with far-reaching consequences. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into the factors associated with suicide and develop effective prevention strategies. However, the complexities involved in studying suicide make it a challenging problem to tackle.
The motivations for exploring this dataset and defining specific project questions arise from the need to address the alarming global suicide rates and their impact on individuals, families, and communities. Preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps us understand the dataset's structure, identify trends, patterns, and potential relationships, and formulate research questions.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to gain insights into global suicide rates and understand the factors associated with them. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, I aim to uncover patterns, trends, and potential correlations within the dataset.
To reach these goals, I will perform thorough exploratory data analysis using various insightful questions and visualizations. The preliminary EDA will help define the project question and guide our analysis. By examining the dataset from different angles and asking specific questions, I can uncover meaningful insights and tell a comprehensive story about global suicide rates.
