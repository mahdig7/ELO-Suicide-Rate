# Reflection
## 1.	Were the original project objectives achieved? Why or why not?
Yes, the original project objectives were achieved. The primary goal was to gain insights into global suicide rates and understand the factors associated with them through exploratory data analysis and visualization. By cleaning the dataset, renaming columns for clarity, and removing incomplete data, a solid foundation was established for the analysis. The project successfully uncovered patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset, addressing the objectives effectively.

## 2.	What was the most valuable or useful learning from your team project?
The most valuable learning from the project was understanding the importance of data cleaning and preparation. This step was crucial in ensuring that the analysis was based on reliable and meaningful data. Additionally, the experience highlighted the significance of visualizations in presenting complex data in an accessible and interpretable manner. These visualizations not only made it easier to identify trends and patterns but also communicated findings effectively to a broader audience.

## 3.	Individual: If you were to do a similar project again as a team, which aspects of the project or which tasks would you delegate to someone else, and which would you take ownership of?
If I were to do a similar project again as a team, I would delegate the initial data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to ensure that the dataset is ready for analysis. This includes tasks such as handling missing data, renaming columns, and ensuring consistency in the dataset. I would take charge of the exploratory data analysis and visualization part of the project. This includes formulating research questions, creating visualizations, and interpreting the results. By focusing on these aspects, I can leverage my strengths in analytical thinking and data visualization to drive the project forward.

## 4.	How did you navigate the project management process? What did you learn?
Navigating the project management process involved setting clear objectives, breaking down the tasks into manageable components, and establishing a timeline for completion. Regular progress checks and updates were crucial in ensuring that the project stayed on track. I learned the importance of flexibility and adaptability in project management. Unexpected challenges, such as missing data, required adjustments to the initial plan.

## 5.	Which elements of the Emerging Talent program were most useful in your work?
Through the rigorous MIT coursework and interactive workshops, I gained valuable knowledge and practical skills in computer and data science. These elements provided me with a solid foundation and equipped me with the necessary skills to analyze complex datasets and draw meaningful insights, which were essential for the success of my project.

## 6.	Share any other thoughts you may have.
One key takeaway is the impact of thorough data analysis on understanding complex issues like suicide rates. While we gained significant insights, further research, and more comprehensive data are needed for a deeper understanding. Incorporating advanced statistical methods in the future could provide even more insights. This project has strengthened my interest in data analysis and its potential to drive meaningful change in areas like public health.
